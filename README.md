Moniq, an Android solution to streaming.
Moniq no longer supports OpenSubsonic streaming. However, you can still download the fully functional latest version that supported it from [here](https://github.com/theherta0000-cell/Moniq/releases/tag/v1.4.0).

Moniq does not in any way take responsibility for any 3rd party sources/links used. Any complaints should be taken up with the 3rd party source themself.
